# ISO 19115 Example Guidance

This documentation aims to demonstrate the detail of guidance that might exist for elements in this tool.

This example has been adapted from draft 'NERC guidance for authors of discovery metadata' version 2.0 (as amended 
2023-12-12).

## Title

### Requirements

1. titles MUST be in English
1. titles MUST describe the resource, they MUST NOT only describe the project or activity which produced it

### Recommendations

1. titles SHOULD be simple and brief (60 characters or less)
1. titles SHOULD include the "what, where, when" in an order that best describes the resource
1. titles SHOULD be written in sentence case

### Guidance

The title should be concise but as informative as possible, explaining the essence of the resource including where
appropriate its temporal and spatial coverage.

For example:

> Biogeochemical Ocean Flux Study (BOFS) North Atlantic Data Set (1989-1991)

### Use of abbreviations

Acronyms or abbreviations MAY be used in the title but uncommon terms MUST be reproduced in full on first use in either:

- the title
- an alternative title (not supported)
- the abstract

Where defined, they SHOULD take the form: '[Full term] [(Abbreviation)]. 

For example:

> Antarctic Digital Database (ADD)

### Larger works

Where resources are part of a larger project, the project SHOULD be included in the title.

Where included, the larger work SHOULD be included in the form: `[Larger work]: [Resource]` or 
`[Resource] (Larger work)`.
